# 1st-Docker-CI/CD
My 1st repository for building Docker images🐳

Hope this clone source can help another folks getting up and running their containers 😉
 -> Running your first container
 -> Building containers
 -> Learning what containers are
 -> Running and removing containers


I'm using the following command after installing Docker Desktop:

docker run -d -p 80:80 docker/getting-started

Once it has started, you can open your browser to http://localhost

Enjoy 🤹🏽‍♂️
