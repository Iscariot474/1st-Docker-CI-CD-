# 1st-Docker-CI/CD
My 1st repository for building Docker images🐳

Hope this clone source can help another folks getting up and running their containers 😉
 -> Running your first container
 -> Building containers
 -> Learning what containers are
 -> Running and removing containers


I'm using the following command after installing Docker Desktop:

----> docker run -d -p 80:80 docker/getting-started

Once it has started, you can open your browser to http://localhost


This project has a docker-compose.yml file, which will start the mkdocs application on your local machine and help you see changes instantly.

----> docker compose up

Enjoy 🤹🏽‍♂️
